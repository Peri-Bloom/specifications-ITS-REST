### Get COMPOSITION by version id [GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/composition/{version_uid}]

Retrieves a particular version of the COMPOSITION identified by `version_uid` and associated with the EHR identified by `ehr_id`.

        taken from EHR.ehr_id.value

### Get COMPOSITION at time [GET /ehr/{ehr_id}/composition/{versioned_object_uid}{?version_at_time}]

Retrieves a version of the COMPOSITION identified by `versioned_object_uid` and associated with the EHR identified by `ehr_id`.
If `version_at_time` is supplied, retrieves the version extant _at specified time_, otherwise retrieves the _latest_ COMPOSITION version.

Without the `version_at_time` parameter, this resource endpoint is similar to [getting COMPOSITION by version id](#composition-composition-get),
but the format and semantics of the `version_uid` and the `versioned_object_uid` identifiers are different.
The former is used to retrieve a specific known version of the COMPOSITION (e.g. one identified by `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515::openEHRSys.example.com::1`),
whereas the later (e.g. an identifier like `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515`) should be used to retrieve a version from the version container whenever the _version_tree_id_ is unknown or irrelevant (such as when most recent version is requested).

See [Resource identification](overview.html#header-resource-identification) for more details about the identifiers usage and meaning.

+ Parameters

    + ehr_id: `7d44b88c-4199-4bad-97dc-d78268e01398` (string) - EHR identifier 
        taken from EHR.ehr_id.value
    + versioned_object_uid: `8849182c-82ad-4088-a07f-48ead4180515` (string) - COMPOSITION identifier taken from VERSIONED_COMPOSITION.uid.value
    + version_at_time: `2015-01-20T19:30:22.765+01:00` (string, optional) - A given time in the extended ISO 8601 format

+ Response 200 (application/json)

    `200 OK` is returned when the COMPOSITION is successfully retrieved.
