= Authentication, Authorization and Scopes

In general _authentication_ is the process of verifying who the end-user is, while the _authorization_ is the process of verifying what specific functionality or data an end-user has access to.
The SMART profile on the underlying {ietf_html}/rfc6749[OAuth2.0 framework^] specifications is designed primarily as a mean of requesting and granting access to resources, focusing mainly on the aspects of the authorization process.

The following sections describes these processes in relation with the *SMART on openEHR* protocol.

== Authentication

In accordance with SMART protocol, the authentication is often a step of the authorization process. Also, for the end-user identity verification steps of the authentication protocol an external framework should be used, such as {oidc_authentication}[OpenID Connect (OIDC)^], but the exact method is beyond the scope of this specification.

=== Available flows

The client _Application_ can authenticate with the _Platform_ using the *SMART on openEHR*, based on the following flows:

- {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.1[OAuth2 Authorization Code^] flow with {ietf_html}/rfc7636[Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)^]
- {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.1[OAuth2 Authorization Code^] flow with `client_secret`
- {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.4[OAuth2 Client Credentials^] flow
- {ietf_html}/rfc7523[JWT Assertion^] flow with {ietf_html}/rfc7515[JSON Web Signature (JWS)^]

The supported authentication flows should be advertised by the _Platform_ in the `.well-known/smart-configuration` endpoint.

SMART protocol distinguish two types of authentication types:

* {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/client-confidential-asymmetric.html[Asymmetric authentication^]:
this is the SMART preferred authentication method because it avoids sending a shared secret over the wire. It can use one of the {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.4[OAuth2 Client Credentials^] or {ietf_html}/rfc7523[JWT Assertion^] flow

* {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/client-confidential-symmetric.html[Symmetric authentication^]:
authenticates a client application using a secret that has been pre-shared between the client and server. It can use the {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.1[OAuth2 Authorization Code^] flow with `client_secret`

The following flows are considered legacy and should not be used:

- {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.2[Implicit Flow^]
- {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-1.3.3[Resource Owner Password Credentials^]

=== Application types

The recommended authentication flow depends also on the type of the client _Application_. There is a distinction between applications based on whether they can hold their credentials (e.g. client secrets) or are capable to secure the client authentication using other means. The following types of client applications are {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html#support-for-public-and-confidential-apps[considered by SMART^]:

- **Confidential** applications: they have the ability to hold a credentials. This includes web applications running on a trusted server, uses additional technology for higher security and backend applications.
- **Public** applications: they do not have the ability to hold a client secret. This includes mobile applications and single page web applications.

The distinction on the client application types can also be made on the basis of the _user interaction_. The following types are considered:

- **Patient facing**: The patient is the direct end-user of this application, or is opened up by a practitioner within the context of a single patient. It can also be opened within the context of an episode related to a patient, but is optional.
- **Practitioner facing**: The practitioner is the end-user of this application. It can be optionally opened up within the context of a patient, or episode.
- **Backend service**: The application is not directly used by an end-user, but is used by another applications or services in the background.

It is recommended that Patient and Practitioner facing applications use one of the Authorization Code Flows to obtain necessary user information and context. Confidential clients can use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE or the Authorization Code Flow with Client Secret. Public clients should always use the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE. Backend applications should always use confidential clients and use the JWT Assertion Flow with JWS or the Client Credentials Flow.

The following table shows the recommended flow for a few example applications:

[width="100%",cols="5,2,3,4",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Application Example | Client Type | User interaction type | Recommended Flow
| Single Page Web Application for a Patient Portal | Public | Patient facing | Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
| Mobile Application for tracking heart rate | Public | Patient facing | Authorization Code Flow with PKCE
| Web Application with Backend for cardiology management | Confidential | Practitioner facing | Authorization Code Flow with PKCE or Authorization Code Flow with `client_secret`
| Realtime alert system for hospital | Confidential | Backend service | JWT Assertion Flow with JWS or Client Credentials Flow
|=======================================================================

== SMART Authorization Flow

Both Patient and Practitioner facing applications have special requirements that cannot be fulfilled only by the standard OAuth2 framework specification. SMART on FHIR {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/app-launch.html#smart-authorization--fhir-access-overview[specifies^] that depending on the session context, applications can be launched in two ways:

1. *Standalone launch*: The Application is opened directly by the end-user, launched outside the end-user session context on the Platform - e.g. by launching the app at `\https://myapp.example.com`. The application decides which Platform to use based on the user's selection.
2. *EHR launch*: The Application is often embedded within the Platform's main user-interface (i.e. a Portal) using an `iFrame`. Additional parameters `launch` and `iss` are passed to the Application to indicate the Platform to use, and the launch context - e.g. `\https://myapp.example.com?launch=123&iss=https://platform.example.com`. This launch method is also referred to as *Embedded iFrame Launch* to avoid potential confusion in relation with {openehr_rm_ehr}#_ehr_package[openEHR Reference Model `EHR`^] specification.

The Authorization Code Flow as {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-4.1[defined in OAuth2 framework^] is a two-step process where:

1. The client first requests an authorization code from the authorization server by redirecting the user to the `authorization_endpoint`.
2. Subsequently, the client exchanges the authorization code for an access token by using the `token_endpoint`.

The SMART protocol specifies a few modifications to the Authorization Code Flow to enhance it for the use-case of Standalone and Embedded iFrame launch, which are described in the following sections.

=== Context Selection

In the _Standalone launch_, a client _Application_ can request (invoke) the _Platform_ for the context selection, if relevant `context-\*` prefixed capabilities are available on the _Platform_. Most Patient and Practitioner facing application will also require during authorization process the _Platform_ to determine and send additional **context** data. This may contain information like the openEHR EHR ID or Patient ID, potentially the Episode ID, and it may be valid for a lifetime of the end-user session.

[.text-center]
.Standalone Launch
image::{diagrams_uri}/smart_standalone_launch.svg[id=smart_standalone_launch, align="center"]

This _context_ data can be used to pre-populate the client _Application_ with the correct data.
The _Platform_ can do this by automatically inferring the _context_ based on the logged-in user, or can provide a screen right after the consent page to select the _context_ in case of ambiguity.

The _Application_ can request the _Platform_ for openEHR related context selection by passing the following special *scopes* in the authorization request:

[width="100%",cols="2,3",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Scope | Meaning
| `launch/patient` | Need patient context at launch time (FHIR Patient resource and openEHR EHR). When launching outside the EHR, ask for the openEHR EHR instance to be selected.
| `launch/episode` | Need episode context at launch time (this is experimental, the semantic and the resource is to be determined).
|=======================================================================

The context data populated by the _Platform_ is returned in the token response along with the `id_token` and `access_token`. The following additional parameters (besides those {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html#launch-context-arrives-with-your-access_token[described by FHIR^]) are added to the token response:

[width="100%",cols="2,3",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Parameter | Meaning
| ehrId | The ID of the openEHR EHR instance associated with the FHIR Patient resource selected in the launch.
| episodeId | The ID of the Episode selected in the launch (this is experimental, the semantic and the resource is to be determined).
|=======================================================================

The application can make use of these parameters to render the correct information to the end-user.

[NOTE]
====
The {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html[launch scopes^] and token attributes from SMART on FHIR can also be combined here for backward compatibility, but they are not covered by this specification.
====

=== Embedded iFrame Launch

Most Practitioner facing, as well as some Patient facing applications will have to be embedded within the end-user's web based front-end (i.e. a Portal) by using an `iFrame`.

The _Platform_ can automatically communicate the correct _context_ for the client _Application_ by passing the `launch` parameter to the application's url. The _Platform_ should also provide the `iss` parameter to indicate its endpoint for the application to use (which for FHIR SMART apps compatibility reasons represents also the FHIR server endpoint).
As an example, an application can be launched by a URL like: `\https://myapp.example.com?launch=123&iss=https://platform.example.com`.

[.text-center]
.Embedded iFrame Launch
image::{diagrams_uri}/smart_embedded_iframe_launch.svg[id=smart_embedded_iframe_launch, align="center"]

The application can then use the `iss` parameter to obtain the _Platform_ configuration from the `.well-known/smart-configuration` endpoint. It then uses the `authorization_endpoint` to start the Authorization Code Flow. The `launch` parameter is passed along to the authorization request.

The following *scope* is also mandatory while passing the `launch` parameter:

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Scope | Meaning
| `launch` | Permission to obtain launch context when Application is launched from an EHR (Embedded iFrame Launch). This should be accompanied by an additional `launch` parameter in the authorization request.
|=======================================================================

It is recommended that the `launch` token be a base64 encoded JSON object, containing the _context_ attributes like the `ehrId`, along with other attributes. The client _Application_ can use this information to pre-populate itself without initiating an authorization request if it is already authenticated. This will enable a seamless experience for the user when switching between patients while using the application within an `iFrame`. This capability can be advertised by adding the `launch-base64-json` _capability_ in the `/.well-known/smart-configuration` response.


== Scopes for openEHR REST API

The _Application_ can request access to the _Platform_ resources using the {ietf_html}/rfc6749#section-3.3[OAuth2.0 scopes^]. {hl7_fhir}/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context.html[SMART defines^] the scope syntax as follows:

`<compartment>/<resource>.<permission>`

The scopes are based on 3 different _compartments_:

- `patient/*`: These scopes are used when the EHR ID is present in the context. Only access to resources in the compartment of the EHR ID is allowed.
- `user/*`: These scopes are used when the user is identified by the Platform. It is usually a practitioner or an administrator. Only access to resources that the user would usually have access to is allowed.
- `system/*`: These scopes are used when the user is not available and the application is a backend confidential application. These scopes are obtained in advance while registering the application and provides (unrestricted) access to resources in the Platform.

For the {openehr_its_rest_releases}[openEHR REST APIs] the following _resource expressions_ are supported:

- `template-<templateId>`: Templates which match the <templateId> expression.
- `composition-<templateId>`: Compositions of the templates which match the <templateId> expression.
- `aql-<queryName>`: AQL Queries that match the <queryName> expression. If the <queryName> is `*`, then all queries as well as ad-hoc queries are allowed.

The `<templateId>` in the above definition follows the blob pattern matching delimited by a `.` period. For example:

- `MyHospital.Template.v0` - Matches only `MyHospital.Template.v0`
- `*.Template.v0` - Matches `MyHospital.Template.v0` and `OtherHospital.Template.v0`
- `MyHospital.**` - Matches `MyHospital.Template.v0`, `MyHospital.Template.v2` and `MyHospital.OtherTemplate.v0`
- `*` - Matches all templates in the system

The `<queryName>` in the above definition follows the blob pattern matching delimited by `.` a period. For example:

- `org.openehr::compositions` - Matches only `org.openehr::compositions`
- `org.openehr::*` - Matches `org.openehr::compositions` and `org.openehr::bloodpressure`
- `org.openehr::**` - Matches `org.openehr::compositions`, `org.openehr::bloodpressure`, `org.openehr::bloodpressure.v1`
- `*` - Matches all queries and ad-hoc queries

The following _permission_ expressions are supported:

- `c`: The ability to create a resource.
- `r`: The ability to read a resource.
- `u`: The ability to update a resource.
- `d`: The ability to delete a resource.
- `s`: The ability to search a resource. In case of `aql-<queryName>` scope, this means the ability to execute the query.

The following table is a maximal representation of the scopes made possible in different _compartment_, _resource_ and _permission_ combinations:

[width="100%",cols="1,2",options="header"]
|=======================================================================
| Scope | Meaning
|`patient/composition-<templateId>.crud` | Permission to create, read, update and delete compositions of `<templateId>` that are within the EHR of the patient in context.
|`user/composition-<templateId>.crud` | Permission to create, read, update and delete compositions of `<templateId>` that are within the EHRs the logged-in user has access to.
|`system/composition-<templateId>.crud` | Permission to create, read, update and delete compositions of `<templateId>` of all EHRs in the system.
|`patient/template-<templateId>.r` | Permission to read a template with `<templateId>`
|`user/template-<templateId>.crud` | Permission to create and read a template with `<templateId>`
|`system/template-<templateId>.crud` | Permission to create, read, update and delete a template with `<templateId>`
|`patient/aql-<queryName>.rs` | Permission to read and execute AQL with `<queryName>` on EHR ID of the patient in context.
|`user/aql-<queryName>.cruds` | Permission to create, read, update, delete and execute AQL with <queryName> on EHR IDs that the logged-in user has access to. If `<queryName>` is equal to the wildcard `*`, this scope will allow the ad-hoc query endpoint.
|`system/aql-<queryName>.cruds` | Permission to create, read, update, delete and execute AQL with `<queryName>`. If `<queryName>` is equal to the wildcard `*`, this scope will allow the ad-hoc query endpoint.
